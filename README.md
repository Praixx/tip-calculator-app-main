### What I learned

During the working on this project, i learnt more about creating reuseable functions in javascript. i also learnt about planning my code and also think of possible errors which may align from the way the user use the web application and i also solved all this problems. During the course of working on this, i learnt about the input event listener and i was able to apply it where necessary. i also learnt more about calling a function multiple times in different location and also more about how this works and more insight on when to do it.
